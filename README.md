# NASA-Image-of-the-day-Background-Updater
This program will automatically download NASA's [Image of the day](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html ) and set it as your Windows Desktop background whenever you boot up your system.

You will need to:

1. Install some Version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

2. Download the chromedriver.exe file (Download it [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads))

3. put a shortcut to the .py file into your Systems autostart folder so it runs automatically
(I put a Tutorial on how to do that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_4eFRBOTKc))
