# NASA-Image-of-the-day-Background-Updater
This program will automatically download NASA's "Image of the day" and set it as your Windows Desktop background.

You will need to:
-install some Version of Google Chrome(theoretically you could replace it with some other browser but that requires some           modification in the code)(https://www.google.com/chrome/)

-Download the chromedriver.exe file (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

-put a shortcut to the .py file into your Systems autostart folder so it runs automatically
